      <h1>REST Guidance</h1>
      <hr/>
      <p>The use of Representational State Transfer (REST) as an architectural style for integrating services and applications brings several benefits, but also poses new challenges and risks. Particularly important among those risks are failures to effectively address quality attribute requirements such as security, reliability, and performance. An architecture evaluation early in the software life cycle can identify and help mitigate those risks. In this report we present guidelines to assist architecture evaluation activities in REST-based systems. These guidelines can be systematically used in conjunction with scenario-based evaluation methods to reason about design considerations and trade-offs.</p>

          <h3>Foundations of REST for Architecture Evaluation</h3>
          <legend>REST Constraints</legend>
          <p>
            Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style for distributed systems [4]. Roy Fielding has described six constraints that define the REST style, each of which promotes a different set of quality attributes. REST can be described as  <i> REST = (C-S, S, $, U, L, CoD) </i>. Each variable in expression is a constraint. Next, we briefly describe each constraint along with respective impact on quality attributes and important points that evaluators should inspect to assess that impact.
          </p>

          <legend><small>1)  Client-Server  <i>(<u>C-S</u>, S, $, U, L, CoD)</i></small></legend>
          <p>
             Client-server is a frequently found architectural style for network-based applications. This style describes distributed systems that involve separate clients that request services from server components over a network connection. In REST, requests are initiated by user agents (clients) and ultimately processed by an origin server (server), which provides services through a resource hierarchy. REST has a strong focus on decoupling client and server; however, several architectures show challenges to define which modules will act either as a client or as a server. The main benefits of the Client-Server style are separation of responsibilities, independent evolution and maintainability. Evaluators should inspect the definition of the boundary between client and server according to cohesion and the independent evolution of each one.

          <h3>Examples of REST General Quality Attribute Scenarios</h3>
          <p>
            A quality attribute is a measurable or testable property of a system that is used to indicate how well the system satisfies the needs of its stakeholders. Here we enumerate general quality attribute scenarios for ten quality attributes that are important to consider when using the REST style. These general scenarios are referenced in the REST design questions to illustrate how they are affected by design decisions. There is no universal definition for each quality attribute, several definitions and taxonomies of quality attributes are found in the literature. But that fact is not an issue in scenario-based architecture evaluations, because what actually defines the quality attribute requirement is the scenario statement. We label a scenario, say as a “usability scenario” or “performance scenario”, merely for organization purposes.

          <h3>REST Design Questions that Affect Quality Attributes</h3>

          <p>In architectures based on the REST style, several design decisions bear quality trade-offs and are driven by the quality attribute requirements. This section covers topics that are particularly relevant when designing REST-based systems: Design of Resources (subsection A); Representation and identification; Documentation and testing; Behaviour, and; Security. In each topic we present the design questions that evaluators should ask referencing to the general scenario that is impacted.</p>

          <legend><small>A. Design of Resources</small></legend>
                <p>
                  Design of Resources is related to the design of operations, capabilities, data elements and other resources that will be exposed in a service interface. When evaluating resource design, the following questions can help to identify risks:
                </p>
                
                <h4>1) What is the domain model of the application?</h4>
                <p>
                    The domain model represents the knowledge about the domain of the application. It describes the various entities, their attributes, roles and relationships. The domain model can be represented, for example, by a UML class diagram. Evaluators should check if the domain model was validated by the application stakeholders.
                </p>
               <h4>2) What data will be exposed as resources?</h4>
                <p>
                    Evaluators should have an overall understanding of what entities will be exposed as resources via REST services.
                </p>
                <h4>3) Are resource representations standardized within the entire application, department, or enterprise?</h4>
                <p>
                    The representation of a given resource should be the same in terms of format (e.g., XML, JSON) and structure across all services that deal with that resource. Ideally, this standardization should be enterprise-wide, but minimally it should span the entire software system. If a given resource has different representations across the system, interoperability is severely impaired. Performance may also be negatively affected due to the need for data format transformations (e.g., JSON to XML) or data model transformation (e.g., XSLT transformation from one schema definition to another). 
                </p>
                <h4>4) What types of service consumers will interact with the REST services?</h4>
                <p>
                    This question should elicit the nature of the software components that will act as consumers to REST services. They can be web pages on a browser, a Java or .NET component running on a server machine, mobile apps, standalone applications, or any other kind of program that can communicate via http. We should also elicit the nature and properties of the communication channel. Are service consumers at the same local network or intranet where the REST service is? How fast and reliable is the connection? Is the communication channel encrypted? 
                </p>

               <legend><small>B. Representation and identification</small></legend>
                <p>The following questions related to the representation and identification of resources can help to spot risks in the design of REST services:</p>
                <legend><small>1) What format is used to represent resources?</small></legend>
                <p>
                    A resource is represented by a document with a media type identified by a name (such as text/xml), and declared in Content-Type http headers. XML (application/xml) is a very common representation format for resources, although other formats, such as HTML, ATOM, and JSON, are also widely used. Development frameworks and platforms provide different levels of support for different formats. The choice of representation format also affects performance and reliability. To achieve interoperability quality attribute scenarios like 

                  <a tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" title="I2 Interoperability Scenario" data-content="A service consumer ‘A’ requests a resource ‘R1’ in a specific format (media type) and receives the representation of the actual state of ‘R1’ in response according to the requested format." id="I2Scenario"><b>I2</b></a>


                    , a REST service may need to use different representations of resources suitable for different devices and systems.
                </p>
               <h4>2) Is a standardized vocabulary defined for the resource?</h4>
