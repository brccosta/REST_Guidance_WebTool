          <h3>EVALUATION PROOF OF CONCEPT</h3>
          <legend>REST Constraints</legend>
          <p>
            The goal of this section is to show the use of the proposed guidance in a proof of concept system evaluation. The scenario-based method employed is the Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM) [5] and it was applied to a Webbased system, briefly described as follows.
          </p>

          <legend><small><i>A. Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM)</i></small></legend>
          <p>
             The ATAM method provides a principled way to evaluate the fitness of a software architecture with respect to multiple competing quality attribute requirements. The method was created to uncover the risks and trade-offs reflected in architectural decisions related to quality attribute requirements. The ATAM method consists of several activities (as described in Section II). The documentation about the method, with all ATAM steps, can be found at <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/tools/evaluate/atam.cfm">http://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/tools/evaluate/atam.cfm</a>. The general scenarios proposed in this paper can be used in different activities of ATAM. Our proof of concept focused on the activities: 3 (Present architecture), which is described in subsection C; 4 (Identify architectural approaches), which is descripted in subsection D; concrete scenarios of activity 5 (Generate quality attribute utility tree), described in subsection E, and on the use of guidance in light of activity 6 (Analyze architectural approaches), which is described in subsection F.         
          </p>    
        
          <legend><small><i>B. System description</i></small></legend>
          <p>
             The system used to evaluate the guidelines proposed in this paper was EcoDiF (Web Ecosystem of Physical Devices) [14]. Interoperability is an important quality attribute requirement for EcoDiF, so the architecture was designed according to REST principles and constraints. EcoDiF is available at http://ubicomp.nce.ufrj.br/ecodif/index_en.html. It is a Web platform to connect devices and products with applications and/or end users in order to provide control, visualization, data processing and storage functionalities. Fig. 3 shows an overview of EcoDiF, illustrating the integration of heterogeneous physical devices and the use of data provided by different kinds of users. EcoDiF has four types of stakeholders: (i) devices manufacturers, which develop drivers to their devices to make them compliant with the EcoDiF open API, as well as data profiles that specify the metadata that describes the type of data provided by the their devices; (ii) data providers, which are device owners that want to make the data produced by their devices available at the IoT ecosystem through EcoDiF; (iii) application developers, which build Web applications or services that use as inputs the data available at EcoDiF as well data produced by any other Web accessible resource, and; (iv) information consumers, which are users that interact with the EcoDiF ecosystem.         
          </p>   
        
          <legend><small><i>C. EcoDiF Architecture Overview</i></small></legend>
          <p>
             Fig. 3 also shows the main modules in EcoDiF. The Devices Connection module aims to facilitate the connection of physical devices to EcoDiF and, consequently, to the Internet. Manufacturers configure their devices according to the EcoDiF interface to enable the integration with the platform. Users connect their preconfigured devices to perform the operations of the provided interface. This connection between the device and EcoDiF is enabled by a customized driver to the specific device, so that data providers can use such driver for connecting their devices and make the data obtained from the devices available at EcoDIF. Data messages (called feeds) are represented using EEML (Extended Environments Markup Language) [15], an XMLbased language that describes data obtained from devices in a specific context. The data is sent by the device to EcoDiF through a driver through http PUT, and users can manipulate the data through EcoDiF Data Manipulation Component.       
              <h1>INSERT IMAGE HERE</h1>
        
          The Visualization and Management module provides a Web interface for users managing the devices connected to EcoDiF. These users can monitor the state and location of their devices, create alerts and notifications (triggers) about the environment, and visualize historical data. The Collaboration module let EcoDiF users perform searches for devices and applications registered with the platform based on their metadata (type, user, location, etc.). The Storage module consists of two repositories, a relational database for the data feeds, and a repository for storing application scripts in a file system. These repositories may use a Cloud Computing infrastructure to store relational data and files to enhance the reliability, security, availability, and scalability of the solution. Finally, the Applications module provides a model and environment for programming and executing applications that can use the data (feeds) available at EcoDiF and generate new information to be available at the platform. In EcoDiF, these applications are built as Web mashups [16]. The EMML (Enterprise Mashup Markup Language) [17] XML-based language is used to develop Web mashup applications by integrating data from several sources, including Web services, third-party APIs, and relational databases.
          </p> 
      
          <legend><small><i>D. Architectural Approaches of EcoDiF</i></small></legend>
          <p>
             The Layered System (<i><u>L</u></i>) constraint is applied by grouping responsibilities in three tiers (Fig. 3): Web Interface, Middleware Services, and Integrated Physical Devices. EcoDiF acts as a web server and physical devices act as Clients (see Section IV). The Stateless (<i><u>S</u></i>) constraint is applied by not keeping state of requests; all resource information is included in the response. It does not have HATEOAS. Code on Demand (<i><u>CoD</u></i>) and Cache (<i><u>$</u></i>) constraints are not applied. Resources were designed according to the EEML protocol. The only resource exposed to clients is a feed. When a user provider creates a feed, EcoDiF assigns an ID to uniquely identify the feed. The URI pattern for identifying the feed is: ecodif.com / api / feed / [ID]. The http method used to request a feed is GET. The same URI is used by user providers to update feeds using http PUT. When a feed is updated, EcoDiF responds with http status code 201, but does not include the URI of the updated feed. To perform a feed update by using PUT, the user credentials must be added as an http header. User providers get their credentials upon registration. If the user provider configures the feed as public, GET is performed without security validations. If the feed is private, only the creator can request the feed representation. The feed uses the application/xml media type. When a resource is requested, EcoDiF sends the full representation of a feed to the client. EcoDiF does not have versioning of resource URI. The EcoDiF interface documentation is available on the web.

          <p>
             Table I shows some quality attribute scenarios for EcoDiF that are relevant to a REST-based architecture. The complete analysis of EcoDiF’s architecture, including all elicited concrete scenarios, can be found at: <a href="http://ubicomp.nce.ufrj.br/restguidance/">http://ubicomp.nce.ufrj.br/restguidance/</a>

             The architecture approaches were probed by using guidelines referenced in Section VI for each scenario.
